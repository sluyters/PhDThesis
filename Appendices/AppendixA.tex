\chapter{Sources}\label{appendixA}
% The software and datasets described in this thesis are published on the web to foster the reproducibility of our experiments and the research in gesture recognition. The source code of the \gester~application and the \uv~and \uf~recognizers are available on GitHub under the ``BSD 3-Clause license'' agreement. \gester~is shared along with the 2D uni-stroke and multi-stroke datasets and the 3D hand gesture datasets used to evaluate state-of-art recognizers. The \gesto~web application is available online and can be used by researchers, practitioners, and any interested reader to collect 2D and 3D gesture samples.
